# hello-world
Hi everyone !

I'm Arnaud, following the introductory guide to Github.
I'm here to learn how to code, starting on Freecodecamp and following with some Python probably. I'm very interested in the blockchain space and the cryptographic features of it, so I'll switch to that as soon as I can.
